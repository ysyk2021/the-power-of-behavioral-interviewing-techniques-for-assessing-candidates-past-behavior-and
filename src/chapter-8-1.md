Using Hypothetical Scenarios to Assess Problem-Solving Abilities
=========================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the effectiveness of using hypothetical scenarios as a technique for assessing candidates' problem-solving abilities during the interview process. By presenting candidates with realistic and challenging situations, interviewers can evaluate their critical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving skills. This chapter will provide insights into designing and implementing hypothetical scenarios, along with strategies for evaluating candidates' responses.
