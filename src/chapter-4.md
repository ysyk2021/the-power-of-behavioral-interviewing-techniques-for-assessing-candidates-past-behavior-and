Conducting effective behavioral interviews is crucial to accurately assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future performance. In this chapter, we will explore techniques for building rapport with candidates, putting them at ease, and actively listening for valuable information.

Techniques for Building Rapport with Candidates
-----------------------------------------------

Building rapport with candidates is essential to creating a comfortable and open environment for the interview. One way to build rapport is to start the interview with some small talk to establish a personal connection with the candidate.

For example, you could ask about their weekend or their hobbies. This can help put the candidate at ease and create a more relaxed atmosphere for the interview.

Another technique is to use positive body language, such as smiling, nodding, and maintaining eye contact. This can help communicate your interest in the candidate and create a sense of trust.

Strategies for Putting Candidates at Ease and Encouraging Open Communication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to make candidates feel comfortable and encourage open communication during the interview. One strategy is to explain the purpose of the interview and what you hope to learn from their responses.

Additionally, it can be helpful to reassure candidates that there are no right or wrong answers and that you are interested in learning about their unique experiences and perspectives.

Creating a safe space for candidates to share their thoughts and experiences can lead to more honest and insightful responses.

Tips for Active Listening and Probing for More Information
----------------------------------------------------------

Active listening is essential to conducting an effective behavioral interview. This involves paying close attention to the candidate's responses and asking follow-up questions to gather additional information.

One way to do this is to ask open-ended questions, such as "Can you tell me more about that?" or "What were the specific steps you took to achieve that goal?"

Additionally, it can be helpful to summarize the candidate's response and repeat it back to them to ensure that you have understood it correctly.

Probing for more information can help uncover valuable insights about the candidate's thought process and decision-making abilities.

In conclusion, conducting effective behavioral interviews requires building rapport with candidates, creating a comfortable and open environment, and actively listening and probing for more information. By mastering these techniques, you can more accurately assess candidates' past behavior and predict their future performance.
