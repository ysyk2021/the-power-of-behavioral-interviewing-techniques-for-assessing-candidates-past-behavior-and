Chapter 1: Introduction
=======================

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful tool for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future job performance. In this book, we will explore various techniques and best practices for conducting effective behavioral interviews.

Why Behavioral Interviewing is a Powerful Tool in the Hiring Process
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Traditional interviews often rely on hypothetical questions or personal characteristics rather than evaluating a candidate's past behavior. Behavioral interviewing, on the other hand, focuses on asking open-ended questions about a candidate's past behavior to predict future job performance.

By evaluating a candidate's past behavior in specific situations related to the job they are applying for, employers can gain valuable insights into their decision-making process, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and other relevant competencies.
