======================================================================================================

Building rapport with candidates is an important aspect of conducting effective behavioral interviews. A comfortable and relaxed candidate is more likely to provide honest and insightful responses about their past behavior. In this chapter, we will explore techniques for building rapport with candidates during the behavioral interview.

Creating a Comfortable Environment
----------------------------------

Creating a comfortable environment can help ease a candidate's nerves and make them feel more at ease. This can include offering them a drink or showing them around the office before the interview begins.

Additionally, it is important to be punctual and respectful of the candidate's time. Starting the interview on time and providing clear instructions can help create a professional and respectful atmosphere.

Establishing a Connection
-------------------------

Establishing a connection with the candidate can help build rapport and encourage open communication. One way to establish a connection is by finding common ground, such as shared interests or experiences.

Another technique is to use active listening skills and show genuine interest in the candidate's responses. By asking follow-up questions and expressing curiosity, the interviewer can create a sense of mutual respect and understanding.

Using Humor
-----------

Using humor can also help create a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. However, it is important to use humor appropriately and avoid offensive jokes or comments.

A lighthearted joke or comment can help break the ice and put the candidate at ease. It can also help create a more memorable experience for the candidate and leave a positive impression of the company.

Conclusion
----------

Building rapport with candidates is an important aspect of conducting effective behavioral interviews. This can be achieved by creating a comfortable environment, establishing a connection, and using humor appropriately.

By building rapport with candidates, interviewers can encourage open communication and gain valuable insights into their past behavior. This can help make better hiring decisions and build successful teams with employees who have the necessary skills, competencies, and personalities to perform well in their roles.
