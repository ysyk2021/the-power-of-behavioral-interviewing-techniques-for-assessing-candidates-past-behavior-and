Developing effective behavioral interview questions is essential to accurately assess candidates' past behavior and predict their future job performance. In this chapter, we will explore strategies for identifying competencies and skills needed for the job, creating questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior, and structuring questions to assess multiple competencies at once.

Identifying the Competencies and Skills Needed for the Job
----------------------------------------------------------

To develop effective behavioral interview questions, it is important to first identify the competencies and skills needed for the job. This can be done by reviewing the job description and speaking with current employees who hold similar positions.

Some examples of competencies and skills might include problem-solving, communication, leadership, teamwork, and adaptability.

Once these competencies and skills have been identified, they can be used to develop predetermined criteria for evaluating candidate responses.

Creating Questions That Elicit Detailed Responses About Past Behavior
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior is crucial to accurately assess a candidate's potential job performance. These questions should be open-ended and specific to the competencies and skills needed for the job.

For example, instead of asking "Are you a good problem solver?", ask "Can you describe a time when you had to solve a complex problem in your previous job? What steps did you take to solve it?"

By asking specific questions about past behavior, you can gain valuable insights into a candidate's decision-making process, problem-solving abilities, and other relevant competencies.

Structuring Questions to Assess Multiple Competencies at Once
-------------------------------------------------------------

Structuring questions to assess multiple competencies at once can save time and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a candidate's skills and abilities.

One way to do this is to use the STAR method, which stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. For example, you could ask a question like, "Can you describe a time when you had to lead a team to solve a complex problem? What steps did you take, and what was the outcome?"

This question assesses the candidate's leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and ability to achieve results.

Conclusion
----------

Developing effective behavioral interview questions is essential to accurately assess candidates' past behavior and predict their future job performance. To do so successfully, it is important to identify the competencies and skills needed for the job, create questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior, and structure questions to assess multiple competencies at once.

By mastering these techniques, organizations can make better hiring decisions and build successful teams with employees who have the necessary skills and competencies to perform well in their roles.
