Chapter 8: Advanced Behavioral Interviewing Techniques: Analyzing Nonverbal Behavior During the Interview
=========================================================================================================

In addition to asking specific questions about past behavior, analyzing nonverbal behavior during the interview can provide valuable insights into a candidate's personality, communication style, and emotional intelligence. In this chapter, we will explore advanced behavioral interviewing techniques for analyzing nonverbal behavior during the interview.

Why Analyzing Nonverbal Behavior is Important
---------------------------------------------

Nonverbal behavior, such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, can provide valuable insights into a candidate's personality, communication style, and emotional intelligence. For example, a candidate who avoids eye contact or fidgets may indicate nervousness or lack of confidence, while a candidate who maintains eye contact and has an open posture may indicate confidence and assertiveness.

Analyzing nonverbal behavior can also help detect dishonesty or inconsistencies in a candidate's responses. For example, a candidate who smiles while discussing a negative experience may be hiding their true feelings.

Techniques for Analyzing Nonverbal Behavior
-------------------------------------------

To effectively analyze nonverbal behavior during the interview, it is important to establish a baseline for each candidate's behavior. This involves observing their behavior during casual conversation before the formal interview begins.

During the interview, pay attention to changes in the candidate's behavior, such as increased fidgeting or shifts in body posture. These changes can indicate discomfort, anxiety, or deception.

Additionally, pay attention to vocal cues, such as tone of voice and pace of speech. A candidate who speaks quickly and loudly may indicate excitement or enthusiasm, while a candidate who speaks slowly and softly may indicate shyness or introversion.

Using Nonverbal Behavior to Supplement Behavioral Interviewing
--------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing nonverbal behavior should supplement rather than replace behavioral interviewing techniques. It is important to remember that nonverbal behavior can also be influenced by cultural background and personal preferences. Therefore, it is important to avoid making assumptions based solely on nonverbal behavior.

Using nonverbal behavior to supplement behavioral interviewing can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a candidate's potential job performance and help make better hiring decisions.

Conclusion
----------

Analyzing nonverbal behavior during the interview can provide valuable insights into a candidate's personality, communication style, and emotional intelligence. By establishing a baseline for each candidate's behavior, paying attention to changes in behavior, and observing vocal cues, employers can gain a more comprehensive evaluation of a candidate's potential job performance.

It is important to remember that nonverbal behavior should supplement rather than replace behavioral interviewing techniques. By mastering these advanced techniques, organizations can make better hiring decisions and build successful teams with employees who have the necessary skills, competencies, and personalities to perform well in their roles.
