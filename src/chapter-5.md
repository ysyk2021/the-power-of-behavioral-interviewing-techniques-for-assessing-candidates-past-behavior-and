After conducting behavioral interviews with candidates, it is important to evaluate their responses and make informed hiring decisions. This chapter will cover techniques for evaluating responses and making fair and objective hiring decisions.

Scoring Candidate Responses Based on Predetermined Criteria
-----------------------------------------------------------

To ensure consistency and fairness in evaluating candidate responses, it is important to establish predetermined criteria for scoring each response. These criteria should be based on the essential job functions and qualifications required for the position.

For example, if you are hiring a sales representative, your predetermined criteria could include communication skills, sales experience, customer service abilities, and problem-solving skills. Each criterion can be assigned a score, such as 1-5, and each response can be scored accordingly.

Using predetermined criteria helps eliminate bias and ensures that each candidate is evaluated fairly and objectively.

Comparing Candidates Fairly and Objectively
-------------------------------------------

After scoring each candidate's responses, it is important to compare them fairly and objectively. One way to do this is by creating a matrix or spreadsheet that lists each candidate's scores for each predetermined criterion.

This allows you to see how each candidate performed in relation to the predetermined criteria and make an informed decision based on their overall performance.

It is also important to consider any additional factors that may impact the hiring decision, such as the candidate's work experience, education, and references.

Using Behavioral Interview Data to Make Hiring Decisions
--------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral interview data provides valuable insights into a candidate's past behavior and potential future performance. However, it is important to use this data in conjunction with other factors when making hiring decisions.

Consider the candidate's fit with the company culture, their work ethic, and any other relevant information before making a final decision.

It is also important to remember that no single candidate will meet all of the predetermined criteria perfectly. Use your best judgement and prioritize the criteria that are most important for the position when making the final decision.

In conclusion, evaluating candidate responses and making hiring decisions based on predetermined criteria and fair comparisons can help ensure that you make informed, objective decisions when selecting the best candidates for your organization.
