Techniques for Assessing Candidates' Past Behavior and Predicting Future Performance
======================================================================================================================================

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful tool for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future performance. In this chapter, we will explore the techniques for conducting effective behavioral interviews.

Asking Open-Ended Questions
---------------------------

Effective behavioral interviewing requires asking open-ended questions that allow candidates to describe specific situations they have encountered in the past and how they responded. Open-ended questions encourage candidates to provide detailed and relevant responses, which can help assess their skills and abilities. Closed-ended questions, on the other hand, often result in short or general answers that do not provide enough information to make an informed hiring decision.

Using the STAR Method
---------------------

The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method is a useful framework for developing and evaluating behavioral interview questions. This framework involves asking candidates to describe a specific situation they encountered, the task they needed to complete, the actions they took, and the result of those actions. By using the STAR method, hiring managers can ensure that candidates provide a detailed and structured response to the question.

Making Questions Job-Specific
-----------------------------

It is important to make sure that behavioral interview questions are job-specific and relevant to the competencies and skills required for the role. This ensures that candidates are being evaluated based on their ability to perform the specific tasks and responsibilities of the position. Questions should be developed that specifically address a candidate's experience in the areas that are most critical for success in the role.

Using Standardized Evaluation Criteria
--------------------------------------

Standardized evaluation criteria should be used to assess the quality of candidate responses. This ensures that all candidates are being evaluated based on the same factors, reducing the risk of bias and subjective opinions. Evaluation criteria might include factors such as the level of detail provided, the clarity of communication, and the effectiveness of problem-solving skills.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, effective behavioral interviewing requires asking open-ended questions, using the STAR method, making questions job-specific, and using standardized evaluation criteria. By using these techniques, hiring managers can more effectively assess candidates' past behavior and predict their future performance. Behavioral interviewing provides more accurate and reliable information about a candidate's skills and abilities than traditional interviews and ultimately contributes to organizational success.
