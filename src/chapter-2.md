Behavioral interviewing is a technique used to assess a candidate's past behavior to predict their future job performance. In this chapter, we will explore what behavioral interviewing is and how it works, the advantages of using behavioral interviewing over traditional interviews, and common mistakes to avoid when conducting behavioral interviews.

What is Behavioral Interviewing and How Does it Work?
-----------------------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing involves asking candidates open-ended questions about their past behavior in specific situations related to the job they are applying for. The goal is to gain insights into a candidate's decision-making process, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and other relevant competencies.

For example, instead of asking a candidate if they have experience working in a team, a behavioral interviewing question might be, "Can you describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member? What steps did you take to resolve the situation?"

By asking specific questions about past behavior, employers can better predict how candidates will perform in similar situations in the future.

Advantages of Using Behavioral Interviewing Over Traditional Interviews
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several advantages of using behavioral interviewing over traditional interviews. First, behavioral interviewing allows employers to gain more accurate insights into a candidate's potential job performance by evaluating their past behavior in relevant situations.

Second, it provides a more objective evaluation process since all candidates are asked the same predetermined questions based on essential job functions and qualifications.

Third, it can help reduce bias in the hiring process by focusing on specific competencies and skills needed for the job rather than personal characteristics or demographics.

Common Mistakes to Avoid When Conducting Behavioral Interviews
--------------------------------------------------------------

To conduct effective behavioral interviews, it is important to avoid common mistakes that can negatively impact the evaluation process. One mistake is not establishing predetermined criteria based on the essential job functions and qualifications required for the position.

Another mistake is not being specific enough in the questions asked. It is important to ask open-ended questions that are specific to the competencies and skills needed for the job.

Additionally, interviewers should avoid leading questions that suggest a particular response or giving too much information about the situation. This can lead to inaccurate assessments of a candidate's past behavior.

Conclusion
----------

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful tool for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future job performance. By asking specific open-ended questions about past behavior in relevant situations, employers can gain valuable insights into a candidate's decision-making process, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and other relevant competencies.

Using behavioral interviewing over traditional interviews has several advantages, including providing a more accurate evaluation process, being more objective, and reducing bias.

To conduct effective behavioral interviews, it is important to establish predetermined criteria, ask specific open-ended questions, and avoid common mistakes that can negatively impact the evaluation process.
