Advantages of Using Behavioral Interviewing over Traditional Interviews
================================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the advantages of using behavioral interviewing techniques over traditional interviews when assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting future performance. While traditional interviews have their merits, behavioral interviewing offers unique benefits that can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the evaluation process.

Predictive Power
----------------

Behavioral interviewing focuses on candidates' past behavior as a strong indicator of their future performance. By delving into specific situations and actions from the candidate's past, behavioral interviewing provides insights into how they are likely to handle similar circumstances in the future. This predictive power allows employers to make more informed decisions and select candidates who have demonstrated the desired behaviors and competencies.

Objective Evaluation
--------------------

Traditional interviews often rely on subjective judgments, impressions, and gut feelings to assess candidates. In contrast, behavioral interviewing follows a structured and standardized approach. Using a predetermined set of behavior-based questions, interviewers can evaluate candidates objectively against specific criteria. This objectivity minimizes biases and ensures a fair assessment for all candidates.

Comprehensive Assessment
------------------------

Behavioral interviewing gathers detailed information about candidates' experiences, actions, and outcomes. Through probing techniques and follow-up questions, interviewers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how candidates have handled challenges, made decisions, and achieved results. This deep dive into candidates' past behavior enables a more accurate assessment of their skills, problem-solving abilities, and fit for the role.

Fair Comparison
---------------

Behavioral interviewing facilitates fair comparisons between candidates. By asking all candidates the same set of behavior-based questions, interviewers create a level playing field for evaluation. This consistency ensures that each candidate is assessed using the same criteria and reduces the likelihood of bias or favoritism. Fair comparisons increase the overall fairness and reliability of the selection process.

Enhanced Candidate Engagement
-----------------------------

The nature of behavioral interviewing encourages candidates to provide detailed and specific responses. By asking them to describe real-life situations and experiences, interviewers can engage candidates more actively in the conversation. This engagement fosters a deeper understanding of the candidates' capabilities, thought processes, and communication skills.

Alignment with Competency Requirements
--------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing is specifically designed to assess candidates against the competencies and skills required for the job. By tailoring behavior-based questions to the role's specific requirements, employers can directly evaluate whether candidates possess the necessary behaviors and experiences. This alignment increases the likelihood of selecting candidates who are well-suited for the position.

Conclusion
----------

When compared to traditional interviews, behavioral interviewing techniques offer several advantages in assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting future performance. The predictive power, objective evaluation, comprehensive assessment, fair comparison, enhanced candidate engagement, and alignment with competency requirements make behavioral interviewing a highly effective tool for hiring decisions. By leveraging these advantages, employers can improve their selection process, identify top talent, and build high-performing teams that drive organizational success.
