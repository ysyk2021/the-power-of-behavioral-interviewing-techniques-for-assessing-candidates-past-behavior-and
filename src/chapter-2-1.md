What is Behavioral Interviewing and How Does it Work?
=======================================================================================================

Behavioral interviewing is a technique used by hiring managers and recruiters to assess candidates' past behavior in order to predict their future performance. In this chapter, we will explore what behavioral interviewing is and how it works.

What is Behavioral Interviewing?
--------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing is a structured interview technique that focuses on specific examples of behavior from a candidate's past experiences. Rather than asking hypothetical questions or generalizations, behavioral interviewing asks candidates to describe specific situations they have encountered, the actions they took, and the outcomes of those actions. By focusing on actual behavior rather than hypothetical scenarios, behavioral interviewing provides more accurate and reliable information about a candidate's skills and abilities.

How Does Behavioral Interviewing Work?
--------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing typically involves a series of open-ended questions that are designed to elicit specific examples of behavior from a candidate's past experiences. These questions are often based on the core competencies or skills required for success in the role. For example, a question for a project management position might be "Tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities on a project. What steps did you take to resolve the conflict and what was the outcome?"

Once candidates have provided their responses, hiring managers and recruiters use a standardized set of evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the response. This might include factors such as the candidate's level of detail, the clarity of their communication, and the effectiveness of their problem-solving skills. By using a standardized evaluation process, hiring managers can ensure that all candidates are being evaluated based on the same factors.

Advantages of Behavioral Interviewing
-------------------------------------

There are several advantages of using behavioral interviewing over traditional interviews. These include improved predictive validity, reliability, objectivity, improved hiring accuracy, and identifying candidates who are a good cultural fit for the organization.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, behavioral interviewing is a structured interview technique that focuses on specific examples of behavior from a candidate's past experiences. By asking candidates to describe their actions in specific situations, hiring managers and recruiters can gain insights into how they are likely to behave in similar situations in the future. Behavioral interviewing provides more accurate and reliable information about a candidate's skills and abilities than traditional interviews, ultimately improving hiring outcomes and organizational success.
