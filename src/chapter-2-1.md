What is Behavioral Interviewing and How Does It Work?
==============================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of behavioral interviewing and its effectiveness in assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future performance. We will discuss what behavioral interviewing entails, its key principles, and how it differs from traditional interviewing methods. Additionally, we will delve into the steps involved in conducting a successful behavioral interview.

Understanding Behavioral Interviewing
-------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing is an interviewing technique that focuses on candidates' past experiences and behaviors as indicators of their future performance. The underlying principle is that past behavior is a strong predictor of future behavior. By analyzing how candidates have handled specific situations in the past, employers can gain valuable insights into their abilities, skills, and fit for the role.

Key Principles of Behavioral Interviewing
-----------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing is guided by several key principles:

1. **Relevance**: The questions asked during a behavioral interview are designed to be directly related to the skills and competencies required for the job. This ensures that the information obtained is relevant and applicable to the candidate's potential performance.

2. **Concrete Examples**: Candidates are asked to provide specific examples of situations they have encountered in the past. These examples should highlight their actions, behaviors, and outcomes. Concrete examples allow for a more accurate evaluation of candidates' abilities and decision-making processes.

3. **Probing for Details**: Interviewers use probing techniques to delve deeper into candidates' responses. This helps uncover specific details about their roles, the challenges they faced, and the impact of their actions. Probing ensures a comprehensive understanding of candidates' experiences.

4. **Consistency**: Behavioral interviewing aims to be consistent across candidates and interviewers. A structured set of questions is used to ensure a standardized evaluation process and enable fair comparisons between candidates.

Conducting a Behavioral Interview
---------------------------------

To conduct a successful behavioral interview, follow these steps:

1. **Job Analysis**: Begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements of the job and the key competencies needed for success. Identify the specific behaviors and skills that are critical for the role.

2. **Develop Behavioral Questions**: Craft a set of behavioral questions that target the identified competencies. These questions should start with phrases like "Tell me about a time when..." or "Describe a situation where...". Each question should focus on a particular skill or behavior.

3. **Interview Structure**: Create a structured interview format where each candidate is asked the same set of questions. This consistency allows for fair evaluation and comparison.

4. **Candidate Engagement**: Put candidates at ease by creating a positive and comfortable environment. Build rapport through active listening, empathy, and respectful communication. Encourage candidates to provide thorough and detailed responses.

5. **Listen and Probe**: Actively listen to candidates' responses and use probing techniques to gather additional information. Ask follow-up questions to explore specific details, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved in the situations described by candidates.

6. **Evaluate and Score**: After the interview, evaluate candidates' responses based on predetermined evaluation criteria. Use a scoring system to objectively assess their demonstrated behaviors and skills. Compare candidates' scores to make informed hiring decisions.

Advantages of Behavioral Interviewing
-------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing offers several advantages over traditional interview methods:

* **Predictive Power**: By focusing on past behavior, behavioral interviewing provides insights into how candidates are likely to perform in similar situations in the future.

* **Objective Evaluation**: The structured nature of behavioral interviews facilitates objective evaluation, as all candidates are assessed against the same set of predetermined criteria.

* **Comprehensive Information**: Through the use of probing techniques, behavioral interviewing gathers detailed information about candidates' experiences, actions, and outcomes, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment.

* **Fair Comparison**: Consistency in questioning and evaluation enables fair comparisons between candidates, reducing bias and increasing the overall fairness of the selection process.

Conclusion
----------

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful technique for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future performance. By focusing on relevant, behavior-based questions and using probing techniques, employers can gain valuable insights into candidates' abilities and fit for the job. Conducting structured and consistent interviews ensures fairness and objective evaluation. Incorporating behavioral interviewing into the selection process can significantly enhance the accuracy of hiring decisions, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes.
