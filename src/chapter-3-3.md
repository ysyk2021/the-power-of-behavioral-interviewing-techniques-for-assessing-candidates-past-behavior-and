Structuring Questions to Assess Multiple Competencies at Once
===================================================================================================================

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful tool for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future job performance. However, developing effective behavioral interview questions that assess multiple competencies at once can be challenging. In this chapter, we will explore tips for developing behavioral interview questions that structure questions to assess multiple competencies at once.

Identifying Relevant Competencies
---------------------------------

Identifying relevant competencies is crucial for developing effective behavioral interview questions. This involves identifying the specific skills and behaviors required for success in the position, as well as considering the organization's culture and values.

By identifying relevant competencies, interviewers can develop questions that are focused on specific skills and behaviors.

Structuring Questions
---------------------

Structuring questions involves creating open-ended questions that allow candidates to provide detailed responses based on their own experiences and behaviors. Additionally, questions should be designed to assess multiple competencies at once, rather than just one specific skill or behavior.

By structuring questions to assess multiple competencies at once, organizations can gain more comprehensive insights into a candidate's potential job performance.

Using the STAR Method
---------------------

Using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) can help interviewers structure questions that assess multiple competencies at once. This involves asking candidates to describe a specific situation or task they faced, the actions they took to address the situation or task, and the results of their actions.

Additionally, interviewers can use follow-up questions to further explore the competencies and skills demonstrated by the candidate.

Avoiding Leading Questions
--------------------------

Avoiding leading questions is crucial for conducting effective behavioral interviews. This includes avoiding questions that suggest a desired response or imply a certain answer.

By avoiding leading questions, interviewers can ensure that candidates are providing honest and accurate responses based on their own experiences and behaviors.

Conclusion
----------

Developing effective behavioral interview questions that assess multiple competencies at once is crucial for building successful teams with employees who have the necessary skills, competencies, and personalities to perform well in their roles. By identifying relevant competencies, structuring questions that assess multiple competencies at once, using the STAR method, avoiding leading questions, and focusing on specific competencies and skills required for success in the position, organizations can develop effective behavioral interview questions that provide valuable insights into a candidate's potential job performance.
