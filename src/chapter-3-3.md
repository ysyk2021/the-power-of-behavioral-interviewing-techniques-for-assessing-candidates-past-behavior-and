In behavioral interviewing, structuring questions that can effectively assess multiple competencies at once is a valuable skill. By combining different competencies in a single question, interviewers can gather comprehensive information about a candidate's abilities and evaluate their suitability for the job more efficiently. This chapter will explore various techniques and strategies for structuring questions that assess multiple competencies simultaneously.

Understanding the Interplay of Competencies
-------------------------------------------

Before structuring questions, it is important to identify the interplay between different competencies. Many competencies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. For example, problem-solving skills often involve critical thinking, decision-making, and adaptability. By understanding these relationships, you can design questions that bring out multiple competencies in a single scenario.

Using the STAR Method
---------------------

The Situation, Task, Action, and Result (STAR) method is a widely used framework in behavioral interviewing. It provides a structured approach for candidates to describe specific situations and actions they took to achieve results. By incorporating different competencies within each component of the STAR method, you can gather information about various skills and abilities simultaneously.

**Question:** Describe a challenging situation you faced at work that required both leadership and effective communication skills. How did you handle it? What actions did you take, and what were the results?

This question combines the competencies of leadership and effective communication, allowing the candidate to demonstrate how they applied both skills in a challenging work scenario.

Introducing Hypothetical Scenarios
----------------------------------

While behavioral interviewing primarily focuses on past behavior, introducing hypothetical scenarios can be useful for assessing multiple competencies. These scenarios simulate real-life situations and enable candidates to showcase their problem-solving abilities, decision-making skills, and other desired competencies.

**Question:** Imagine you are leading a team working on a complex project that has tight deadlines. One of your team members is consistently missing deadlines and causing delays. How would you address this situation, and what steps would you take to ensure the project stays on track? How would you communicate with the team during this process?

This question assesses leadership, problem-solving, decision-making, and communication skills in the context of a hypothetical scenario.

Incorporating Prioritization and Time Management
------------------------------------------------

Prioritization and time management are essential competencies in many roles. By incorporating these factors into your questions, you can assess candidates' abilities to manage multiple tasks, meet deadlines, and make effective use of their time.

**Question:** Describe a situation when you had to juggle multiple priorities with tight deadlines. How did you prioritize your tasks, and how did you ensure everything was completed on time without compromising quality?

This question assesses both prioritization and time management skills, allowing candidates to showcase their ability to handle multiple responsibilities and deliver results within challenging timeframes.

Evaluating Adaptability and Resilience
--------------------------------------

Adaptability and resilience are crucial competencies for navigating change and overcoming setbacks. Incorporate these competencies into your questions to assess candidates' ability to adjust to new circumstances, learn from failures, and persist in the face of challenges.

**Question:** Tell us about a time when you had to adapt to unexpected changes in a project. How did you handle the situation, and what strategies did you use to ensure successful outcomes despite the disruptions?

This question evaluates both adaptability and resilience by prompting candidates to describe how they responded to unexpected changes and achieved positive results despite the challenges.

Conclusion
----------

Structuring questions that effectively assess multiple competencies at once is a valuable technique in behavioral interviewing. By understanding the interplay between different competencies, using the STAR method, introducing hypothetical scenarios, incorporating prioritization and time management, and evaluating adaptability and resilience, interviewers can gather comprehensive information about candidates' abilities and make more informed hiring decisions. These structured questions enable interviewers to assess candidates' skills and competencies in a holistic manner, providing a more accurate and thorough evaluation of their potential for success in the role.
