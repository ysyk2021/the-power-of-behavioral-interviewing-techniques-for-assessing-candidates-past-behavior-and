Chapter 3: Developing Behavioral Interview Questions: Creating Questions that Elicit Detailed Responses about Past Behavior
===========================================================================================================================

Behavioral interviewing is a powerful tool for assessing candidates' past behavior and predicting their future job performance. However, developing effective behavioral interview questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior can be challenging. In this chapter, we will explore tips for developing behavioral interview questions that create detailed responses about past behavior.

Focusing on Specific Behaviors
------------------------------

Focusing on specific behaviors is crucial for creating questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior. This involves identifying the specific skills and behaviors required for success in the position and developing questions focused on those competencies and skills.

Additionally, questions should be open-ended and ask candidates to describe specific examples of when they demonstrated those skills or behaviors in the past.

Using the STAR Method
---------------------

Using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) can help interviewers structure questions that create detailed responses about past behavior. This involves asking candidates to describe a specific situation or task they faced, the actions they took to address the situation or task, and the results of their actions.

Additionally, interviewers can use follow-up questions to further explore the candidate's thought process and decision-making abilities.

Avoiding Hypothetical Questions
-------------------------------

Avoiding hypothetical questions is crucial for creating questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior. This includes avoiding questions that ask candidates what they would do in a hypothetical situation, rather than asking them to describe a specific example of when they faced a similar situation in the past.

By focusing on past behavior, interviewers can gain valuable insights into a candidate's potential job performance.

Providing Context
-----------------

Providing context is important for creating questions that elicit detailed responses about past behavior. This involves providing candidates with information about the organization, the position, and the specific competencies and skills required for success.

Additionally, interviewers should provide candidates with enough time to think about their responses and provide detailed examples of their past behavior.

Conclusion
----------

Developing effective behavioral interview questions that create detailed responses about past behavior is crucial for building successful teams with employees who have the necessary skills, competencies, and personalities to perform well in their roles. By focusing on specific behaviors, using the STAR method, avoiding hypothetical questions, providing context, and allowing candidates enough time to think and respond, organizations can develop effective behavioral interview questions that provide valuable insights into a candidate's potential job performance.
